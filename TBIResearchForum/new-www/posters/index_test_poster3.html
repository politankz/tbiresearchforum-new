                        INTRODUCTION:  TBI due go blast injury (BI) has been the signature medical problem of the OEF/OIF campaigns.  An issue of importance is whether pure blast injury (BI) without Direct Head Trauma (DHT) produces brain injury similar to that with DHT.  This study compares the Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS) produced by these two types of mechanisms of TBI over a period of up to 8 years after TBI.
                        <br><br>
                        OBJECTIVE:  Compare symptoms of the PCS produced by primary and secondary blast injury with that produced by DHT within periods of 1-4 and 5-8 years post-injury.
                        <br><br>
                        METHODS:  The Veterans Administration authorized free medical care for 5 years to all OEF/OIF Veterans.  Those who opted for this program in the Oklahoma City area were evaluated in an induction clinic and a general health screening Questionnaire which included information about TBI was administered by a medical professional.   Those with a deployment-related TBI (D-TBI) were referred to a special TBI clinic established specifically to deal with DTBI.  This clinic was staffed by M.D. and Physician Assistant personnel with specific training for TBI.  A second screening questionnaire was administered by these personnel, which included information about D-TBI and TBI that may have occurred before or after deployment.  The questionnaire included questions about symptoms that relate to past and current occurrence of symptoms related to the PCS, psychiatric problems, as well as current marital and employment situation.  The symptoms queried were graded as none, mild, moderate, severe and very severe. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was employed to assess depression.   The Longitudinal aspect of the study was achieved by comparing those with injury 1-4 years versus 5-8 years prior to being seen in the TBI clinic.
                        <br><br>
                        TBI due to blast was divided into four categories as specifies by the Army Medical System as:  1. Primary – pure blast with no DHT, 2. Secondary – Blast injury with dust or sand but no DHT from an object large enough to produce injury by itself, 3. Tertiary – Blast with DHT due to the blast, and 4. Quarternary – Blast with other bodily injury.  A fifth category of TBI due to DHT with no blast involved is added here. The data here deals with comparison of PCS symptoms in  Veterans suffering Primary or Secondary blast injury (#1 and 2) versus those with DHT only (#5) at periods of 1-4 years and 5-8 years after D-TBI.
                        <br><br>
                        The symptoms chosen to represent the PCS include:  1. Headache, 2. Dizziness, 3. Balance Difficulty, 4. Poor coordination, 5. Difficulty with Decisions, and 6. The BDI. The Liklihood-Ratio Chi-Square test was used to compare groups of Blast versus DHT subjects as well comparison of symptoms within groups at 1-4 and 5-8 years after TBI.  For symptoms #1-5,  three categories of none, mild-moderate, and severe-very severe were employed.  For the BDI score (range 0=60), categories of none (0-9), minimal (10-15), and moderate + (16+ ) were used.
                        <br><br>
                        RESULTS:  The OEF/OIF program evaluated 5782 Veterans between June 12008 and April 2011 of which 1332 had a possible D-TBI and were referred to the TBI clinic. The results deal with the first 500 subjects with a D-TBI seen.  In the groups 1-4 years post-TBI, there were 56 blast and 63 DHT subjects. In the groups 5-8 years post-TBI, there were 28 blast and 50 DHT subjects.   In comparing the primary/secondary blast versus the DHT subjects, there was no difference in the occurrence of symptoms #1-5 representing the PCS with the exception of mild/moderate poor coordination in those 5-8 years post-TBI, which occurred 1.7 times as often in the group of DHT as opposed to blast subjects.   There was no difference between groups in the occurrence of Depression. The results will be presented in detail
                        <br><br>
                        CONCLUSION:  Blast injury without head trauma and direct head trauma both produce a PCS which essentially the same regardless of the etiology of the TBI.
