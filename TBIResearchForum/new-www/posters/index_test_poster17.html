                        Background: In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs started to encourage the use of the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 Participation Index (M2PI) to better identify the long-term psychosocial consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. As in the civilian sector, the vast majority of TBIs in returning Veterans are classified as mild in nature.  While the M2PI has generally showed good interrater agreement, Malec (2004) demonstrated that civilians who sustained a mild TBI generally rate themselves as more impaired on the M2PI than clinicians. At this time, little is known about the psychometric properties of the M2PI in the Veteran population.
                        <br><br>
                        Methodology:  The 144 OEF/OIF/OND Veterans (mean age=31.6 years, 134 males) included in this study were referred for neuropsychological evaluation following the completion of the Comprehensive TBI Evaluation. Veterans with a history of moderate or severe traumatic brain injury were excluded. The M2PI clinician and patient rating forms were administered as part of a collaborative research database across several VA hospitals. Due to variation in administration procedures, item 7 was replaced with an objective rating of current employment status to determine a mean score, but excluded from rater comparisons.
                        <br><br>
                        Results:  Veterans reported greater impairment, activity limitations, and participation restrictions than clinicians across all items on the measure. On the 8-item M2PI, Veterans endorsed a mean total score of 11.50 (SD=5.83, range=1-27), whereas clinicians assigned a mean total score of 6.26 (SD=4.88, range=0-22). Correlations among the two raters ranged from rs=0.25 (item 5, residence) to rs=0.57 (item 2, social contact) across items, with an overall correlation of rs=0.53. When symptom amplification was indicated on a separately administered symptom validity indicator (i.e., MMPI-II FBSâ‰¥26), both Veterans and clinicians rated items 2 (social contact), 3 (leisure and recreation), and 4 (self-care) as significantly more problematic (p<.01) relative to Veterans who passed the symptom validity indicator and the respective clinician ratings.
                            <br><br>
                            Conclusion:  Clinician and Veteran raters demonstrated weak to fair reliability across items and total score on the M2PI. Consistent with Malec (2004), Veterans reported higher levels of impairment, activity limitations, and participation restrictions relative to clinician ratings. While symptom amplification did not significantly impact interrater agreement, higher clinician ratings on the M2PI for those Veterans who demonstrated possible symptom amplification, suggests the need for more objective indicators of functional outcome.
