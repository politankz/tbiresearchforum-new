                        The War Related Illnesses and Injuries Studies Center (WRIISC) at the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Healthcare Center is one of three WRIISC sites in the nation. The WRIISC focuses on the health needs of post-deployment veterans. Post-deployment veterans are seen by a team of psychologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, neurologists, neuroradiologists, nurses, M.D.’s, researchers, and educators in order to best meet their unique health concerns. The WRIISC research team has implemented a “bench to bedside” approach into their practice. This means that WRIISC researchers are dedicated to integrating the knowledge gained through research into clinical practice here at WRIISC. The following case study is one example of an opportunity for such “bench to bedside” implementation.
                        <br><br>
                        W.J. is a 43 year-old, Filipino, retired, married, US Navy (’90-’10) veteran male with 12 years of education who came to the WRIISC with history of significant head trauma, complaints of chronic back and knee pain, a diagnosis of PTSD, and cognitive complaints. During his military service, he stated that he hit his head on metal valves on his ship several times and experienced post-concussive symptoms but no loss of consciousness. He also reported that in 1991, while fighting a fire on his ship, he fell from the upper deck to the lower deck, hurting his back and hitting his head. W.J. was unsure if he lost consciousness during this episode, but did feel lightheaded, nauseous and dizzy. He was, however, immediately sent back to fight the fire and did not seek medical attention after this incident. It was after this head injury that W.J. noticed considerable changes in his personality and mood. He then reported new symptoms of emotional lability which included crying much more easily, became quick to anger, and increased engagement in risky and impulsive behaviors. Concurrent with these symptoms he reported becoming severely depressed. Prior to evaluation at the WRIISC, W.J. believed his biggest problem was his PTSD, which he felt was affecting his mood and behavior. During his visit to the WRIISC W.J. was given an extensive neuropsychological battery and was found to be impaired in auditory memory on the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II Standard Form). He experienced difficulty on the CVLT even when cued, and gave numerous false positives on the recognition trial of this task. The patient also demonstrated impairments in executive functioning on the Trails B exam. The executive functioning deficits he exhibited were consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD . Neuroimaging demonstrated numerous scattered bifrontal white matter signal abnormalities, which can be seen in the setting of prior head trauma. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) also demonstrated abnormal bifrontal fiber tracts, which has been demonstrated in TBI patients.
                        <br><br>
                        Because it has been found that people with frontal lobe damage can be more impulsive, have trouble with emotional regulation, have executive functioning problems, present with personality changes, and present with numerous false positives on recognition tasks, it is suggested that W.J.’s presentation may be related to frontal lobe injury in place of, or in addition to his PTSD. By implementing this bench to bedside practice, we are gaining insight into potential target areas to focus cognitive rehabilitation that the diagnosis of PTSD alone may have excluded. As the symptoms of PTSD and TBI can very similar and difficult to disentangle, our case presents potential neuroimaging and neurocognitive testing approaches that may aid in the diagnosis and management of patients with both conditions.
