                        Background: There is a great unmet medical need for more efficacious treatments for traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI occurs in two stages; the first stage is due to mechanical damage from the impact or blast, and the second occurs as an inflammatory response that includes blood-brain barrier breakdown, edema, excitotoxicity, and free radical generation leading to increases in inflammatory cytokines and microglia cells. Because the second stage occurs after the initial injury, it represents a window for clinical intervention.  Extensive data from studies of ischemic stroke have shown that either pre- or post-conditioning with diverse stimuli including brief ischemia or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce a powerful neuroprotective response that reduces the extent of neuronal injury in animal models. This phenomenon has been referred to as “ischemic tolerance”.  Neuroprotection from ischemic tolerance or conditioning appears to result from a common mechanism that results in reprogramming the response to injury and triggers expression of new genes and protein synthesis.  We previously showed that post-injury treatment with LPS from Escherichia coli or with lipooligosaccharide (LOS) from Neisseria meningitidis reduced the death of neuronal cells in an in vitro scratch model of TBI (Bingham et al., Brain Res. Bull. 85, 403–409, 2011).  Herein we describe our recent findings (Bingham et al., J. Neuroimmunol, in press) regarding the effect of intravenous (IV) or intranasal (IN) administration of E. coli LPS and N. meningitidis LOS on levels of cerebral inflammatory cells and circulating blood cells in a rat model of neuroinflammation induced by intrastriatal injection of IL-1β to mimic the second stage of TBI.
                        <br><br>
                        Methodology: Inflammation was induced by stereotaxic injection of IL-1β into the brain of anesthetized rats. Injury and treatment groups had a minimum of 12 animals and control groups had 6 animals. LPS or LOS (500 μg/kg) was administered IV via the tail vein or IN 2 h pre- or post-injection of IL-1β. The rats were euthanized 12 h following IL-1β injection. Brain sections were immunostained with antibody to ED-1, a microglia cell marker, and analyzed microscopically. Cells in whole blood were assessed with a VetScan HM2 analyzer, and cytokine levels in sera were analyzed with a Bio-Plex system.
                        <br><br>
                        Results: Pre- and post-injury IV treatment with LPS and LOS statistically significantly reduced (from approximately 45 to 70%) the ED-1 positive microglia cells proximal to the site of injection of IL-1β in the brain. IN pre-treatment with LPS or LOS showed a statistical trend towards reducing microglia. Pre- and post-treatment IV with LOS also increased circulating levels of IL-2 and IL-4, whereas IN post-treatment with LPS reduced levels of the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IFN-γ. The number of circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes were reduced.
                        <br><br>
                        Conclusion: There is considerable evidence that the neurodestructive capabilities of microglia play an important role in pathological states including brain injury and trauma through the release of toxic mediators and by increasing inflammatory infiltrates. Our results demonstrated the potential therapeutic effect of IV administration of LPS and LOS on neuroinflammation induced by intrastriatal injection of IL-1β into rats, showing that these treatments inhibited a damaging inflammatory response induced by the IL-1β. Our results confirm and expand on those of Davis et al. (Eur. J. Neurosci. 22, 2441–2450, 2005), who reported that the number of ED-1 positive macrophages and microglia, and leukocytes at the site of injury and in the blood, was markedly reduced by IV administration of E. coli 0111:B4 LPS to rats before or after either stereotaxic injection of IL-1β into the striatum to induce neuroinflammation or the induction of a contusion spinal cord injury. Our approach to reducing inflammation in TBI could have significant advantages over administration of broad spectrum anti-inflammatory agents that give rise to concern about potential harmful effects from attenuation of properties of virtually all the brain cells including neural progenitor cells. The results strongly support continued study of post-conditioning with LPS or LOS as potential neuroprotective treatments for TBI.
