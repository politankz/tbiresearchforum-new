                        Background<br>
                        The “Health Surveillance for a New Generation of US Veterans” (New Gen) was one of the first epidemiological studies to examine the health outcomes of Veterans returning from the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan—Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). The study began in 2005 and involved a postal survey of a stratified random sample of 59,995 Veterans that included 29,995 Veterans who had been deployed and 30,000 non-deployed Veterans who had served during the same era.   The primary findings revealed that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) were more prevalent in these conflicts than expected.  The current study entitled “Markers for the Identification, Norming, and Differentiation of TBI and PTSD” (MIND) sought to follow up on this study sample with the primary aims of exploring differences in the diagnosis of TBI and PTSD, and help build objective and consistent diagnostic criteria for both conditions.  The recruitment of a sample of the original participants is a major challenge when conducting such population-based studies.  Accordingly, a pilot study was conducted to measure feasibility. Three WRIISC centers participated in the study located at the VA Palo Alto (CA), VA Washington DC (DC), and VA East Orange (NJ).
                        <br><br>
                        Methodology<br>
                        A sample of 651 Veterans was identified for potential participation (529 males, mean age = 39.1 yr, range = 26.7 to 52.8 yr).   In order to increase the likelihood of recruiting individuals who lived locally, we focused on those whose current address indicated they lived within a 60-mile radius of one of the three study centers (n=445).  All Veterans were sent an Advance Letter providing them with study details.  Telephone screening began two weeks later with the purpose of establishing study criteria, including screening questions related to current PTSD (PCL-C) and history of head injury.

                        Results
                        A total of 362 Veterans were called across a 23-week period.  Of these, 146 Veterans were successfully contacted and 66 individuals were screened.  The major reasons that individuals were not screened included no interest in the study (n=37), losing contact (n=30), and distance from study site (n=30).   Following screening, 36 Veterans were found to be eligible for the study, and 23 were enrolled.  The reasons for not enrolling eligible individuals included losing contact (n=6), failure to keep study appointments (n=3), failure of participants to follow up (n=2) and schedule conflict (n=2).  The most common reasons for non-eligibility included non-deployment TBI (n=9), poor cognition (n=6), and deployment < 30 days (n=5).
                            <br><br>
                            Conclusion<br>
                            The recruitment rates demonstrate where some of the challenges are when performing population-based studies.  Factors limiting recruitment in such studies include the stringency of inclusion and exclusion criteria, outdated contact information, and the location of study sites.
