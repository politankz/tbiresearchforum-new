                        Background: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) has often been reported to cause damage to axons within white matter, especially within the fibers of the callosal commissure even in mild (mTBI) cases.  However, recent reports analyzing patients having mTBI injuries with blast etiology seem to indicate that there is little or no damage within the callosum in the chronic stage of injury.  We collected multimodal magnetic resonance (MR) data from a small group of mTBI patients from recent military conflicts, a majority with blast injuries, in order to characterize structural features of the mid-callosal fibers relative to a matched control population and to estimate deficits in the mTBI population.
                        <br><br>
                        Methodology:  A 1.5 T Phillips MR scanner was used to image 16 mTBI patients, veterans from OIF/OEF/OND conflicts, where 8 had blast as the primary cause of mTBI and 5 others had experienced concussive blast in combat.  An age, sex, handedness, and education-matched control group of 27 subjects (14 veterans) were also imaged along with 60 more normal controls for testing imaging properties reliability.  MR imaging sequences collected included diffusion imaging (DTI) for evaluating fiber integrity, magnetization transfer (MTR) and T1 imaging for estimating myelination, T2* GRE for imaging hemosiderin deposits, and T1 imaging for automated morphological analysis using C8 software.
                        <br><br>
                        Results:  There was a significant group deficit in patient diffusion scores (FA and MD) only in the anterior mid-body area and a moderate trend towards deficit in myelination scores (T1 and MTR) in the callosal mid body, but no callosal regional area differences or clear GRE deficits anywhere.  However only three of the 16 subjects had individually significant abnormalities (uncorrected) in the anterior mid-body in any of the imaging modalities, with most subjects only showing at best weak deficit trends.  Further, when the covariates of intracranial volume and overall post-traumatic checklist (PCL) scores were added to the analysis, the apparent group deficits in the anterior midbody callosum images of the patients completely disappeared.
                        <br><br>
                        Conclusion:  We find no evidence of TBI-related deficits in the mid-sagittal corpus callosum, despite the fact that 10/16 patients of our sample experienced a loss of consciousness from their mTBI.  However the patient group differed from the matched controls in several additional respects possibly relevant to the results: the patients suffered from higher levels of chronic pain, sleep disorders, and tinnitus in addition to having experienced more combat (and post traumatic stress) than did the controls.
