                Background: Following a TBI, stress can affect and impact the recovery of a person for years to come. Walking and exercise are used by many people as a stress management tool. People often find themselves more calm and peaceful and able to manage their daily lives better when they exercise on a regular basis. With this in mind, as well as input from focus groups conducted with people with a TBI, a home based, 12 week goal oriented, walking program was created as a potential way to combat perceived stress.
                <br><br>
                Methodology:  After a preliminary safety and baseline assessment, subjects were randomized into either a walking or nutrition group for the first 12 weeks of the study. While the walking module of the study was considered the intervention, the nutrition component was regarded as the control group. Using a pedometer to measure their daily steps, subjects assigned to the walking program completed an initial baseline week where the subject continued with a typical week of walking. Following that week, they were given an individualized goal with a 5% increase from their baseline week average. Subsequently a gradual 5% increase in that goal was given by an assigned coach each week, until the subject reached a 40% increase in week eight and maintained that increase for the last four weeks of the study. For the nutrition module, subjects were educated in areas of healthy eating that they deemed important to them. After the first 12 weeks, subjects were switched over to the opposing program that they had not yet completed.  A coach was assigned to contact the subjects each week in order to encourage and troubleshoot with them any problems they were encountering with meeting either their nutrition or walking goals. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) data was collected as a self-report questionnaire at 3 time points in the study: baseline, 12 weeks after baseline and 24 weeks after the baseline appointment. Data was analyzed to determine if either or both of the two groups contributed to less perceived stress for the participant.
                <br><br>
                Results: Complete data at all three time points was available for 69 subjects, who were typically many years post injury. Results showed that regardless of when the walking module was completed within the research study, either immediately following the baseline appointment or after the initial 12 weeks of the study, stress perception decreased for participants. The nutrition module did not impact perceived stress for subjects.
                <br><br>
                Conclusion: Walking and exercise can be utilized as effective stress management tools for people with a TBI.
