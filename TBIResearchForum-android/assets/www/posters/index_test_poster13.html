                        Objective : To determine whether two proposed effort measures for the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) predict decrements on other neurocognitive tests.
                        <br><br>
                        Participants and Methods: 70 military personnel and veterans with positive screens for mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) completed the RBANS (Randolf 1998) as part of a comprehensive battery. We calculated the RBANS effort measures of Silverberg et al 2007 (ES) and Novitsky et al 2012 (EN), and tested whether failing them related to lower scores on other tests (1-tail t-test, alpha=.05).
                        <br><br>
                        Results : Subjects who failed either effort test scored significantly lower on RBANS measures of attention and memory (Digit Span, Word List, Story and Figure Recall), processing speed (Coding, Semantic Fluency), and Line Orientation, but not other RBANS tests. Subjects failing either effort measure also scored significantly lower on non-RBANS tests of processing speed, dexterity, visual search, visual memory, affect recognition, executive skills, and had higher Beck Anxiety scores. EN and ES were not related to age, education, vocabulary, reported TBI severity indices, posttraumatic stress or depression. On most measures, EN showed larger effect sizes than ES.
                        <br><br>
                        Conclusions : Test effort is not a unitary factor that affects all domains equally during testing. EN and ES are expected to correlate with the RBANS attention and memory tasks, from which they are calculated. However, failing EN and ES was also associated with lower RBANS and non-RBANS measures of processing speed, memory, visual-spatial, fine-motor and executive skills. This verifies the relevance of these embedded effort measures to a broader range of neurocognitive assessments. Effect sizes for EN and ES were consistent with other studies suggesting that EN may be a psychometrically stronger measure of effort. These findings also prompt future studies to identify both neurologic and motivational contributors to poor effort, which may be addressed during feedback and treatment.
