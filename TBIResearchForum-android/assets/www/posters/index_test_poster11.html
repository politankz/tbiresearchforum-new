                        Statement of the Problem: The Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is a brief neuropsychological assessment that is widely used in many clinical settings, due to its broad coverage of many cognitive skills in a short amount of time. However, the RBANS does not include an index of executive functions, which are cognitive abilities required for the execution of goal directed activities. Prior studies have demonstrated the importance of assessing executive dysfunction, to account for decreased level of functioning. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether an index of executive functions can be derived from subtests composing the RBANS.
                        <br><br>
                        Subjects: 68 veteran and active duty military at a Regional Veterans Affairs (VA) Polytrauma Network Site (PNS) were selected based on a positive TBI screen, using the standard national VA screening assessment. Their median age = 28, education =13, premorbid IQ= 99.
                        <br><br>
                        Procedure: Subjects completed  the RBANS as part of a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. We created an external Executive Composite by averaging z-scores of 12 executive tasks: Trails B, Wisconsin Card Sort, Digit Span Backward, Spatial Span Backward, Letter-Number Sequencing, Shipley Abstraction, D-KEFS Inhibition-Switching, Letter Fluency, Category Switching, NAB Numbers and Letters B, Mazes, and Word Generation.  We estimated premorbid IQ from Shipley Vocabulary and Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, and obtained Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventory scores.
                        <br><br>
                        Results: Three RBANS tests correlated r>.5 with the external Executive Composite: Coding, Semantic Fluency, and List Recognition (r=.8, .6, .5, all p<.001). An RBANS Executive Index was calculated by averaging z-scores of these tests. RBANS Executive Index correlated r=.8 with the external Executive Composite. Multiple regression indicated that these three RBANS subtests each contributed uniquely to the correlation with external executive measures. After controlling for Premorbid IQ, Processing Speed, Depression, and Anxiety, the above correlations all remained significant: RBANS Executive Index (partial r=.7, p < .001) and the three RBANS subtests (all partial r >.4, p<001). The RBANS Executive Index correlated most highly with Inhibition-Switching, Letter-Number Sequencing, and Mazes (all r>.5, p<.001).
                            <br><br>
                            Conclusion: The strongest correlates with executive functioning were RBANS Coding, Semantic Fluency and List Recognition. Executive skills tapped by these tests include verbal and spatial organization, cognitive flexibility, and effort. The analyses indicated that general abilities (IQ and processing speed) did not account for the high correlation of these RBANS tests with executive skills. This correlation was also relatively unaffected by depression and anxiety in this sample. These preliminary results suggest the utility of a new RBANS Executive Index, consisting of the mean z-score of these three RBANS tests. Future studies are required to cross-validate this index in other clinical samples. The addition of this index potentially increases the value of the RBANS as a quick assessment of diverse cognitive functions, including executive skills.
