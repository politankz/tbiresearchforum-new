                        Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI), known as the “signature injury” of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, is a serious public health problem among veterans and active duty military personnel in the United States. Since 2002, the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC) at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Healthcare System (VAPAHCS) has actively conducted a Prospective TBI Clinical Tracking study (CTF) as part of the national TBI registry and tracking system. CTF is a multi-site, longitudinal study conducted among TBI patients injured in theater, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF/OEF) as well as other situations from date of injury up to 20 years post-injury. Data collected in this study include: etiology of TBI with demographics, injury severity, neurological functioning, associated injuries, life satisfaction, neurobehavioral and post-traumatic stress symptomatology, and outcomes.
                        <br><br>
                        Objective: To create a master database and to analyze the descriptive and observational data.
                        <br><br>
                        Methods: Participants include consenting Military and Veterans age 18 and older with confirmed TBI diagnosis. Information was collected through patient interviews, questionnaires, review of patients’ medical and service records, and follow-up interviews at years 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. A descriptive analysis was conducted on patients who enrolled from 2002 through 2012.
                        <br><br>
                        Results: A total of 196 participants have been enrolled to date with an average of 18 participants per year. The majority of participants are male, 187 (95%). Grouping by age, the 19-34 year-old cohort comprised 137 (70%) of the population. Age-group was selected based on the eligibility of the military service. One-hundred and twelve (57%) participants have severe TBI, followed by 55 (28%) with mild TBI (mTBI), and 29 (15%) with moderate TBI. Nine out of 196 participants had both, head and spinal cord injuries. Ninety-seven (50%) of the TBIs occurred in OIF/OEF and, specifically, 78 out of 97 (80%) of the TBIs that occurred in theater were blast related. Thirty-eight (48%) of those blast-associated injuries were mTBI. A chi-square analysis that looked at brain injury severity where injury occurred, revealed a significantly greater proportion of moderate and severe injuries occurred out of theater 84% (p <0.05). Among blast participants wearing protection (helmet and helmet/body armor), 90% of TBIs were protected.
                            <br><br>
                            Conclusion: The analysis of the data reveals that half of the blast related injuries were associated with mTBI among the 19-34 year-old participants. Most of the blast associated injuries were protected.
