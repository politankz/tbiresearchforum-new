                        Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in cognitive, emotional, behavioral and neurological deficits that can persist more than a year after injury. Studies utilizing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) often fail to demonstrate differences in pathology between mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients with and without persistent neurocognitive deficits (i.e., post-concussive symptoms), though 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) studies suggest metabolic changes may be different in individuals with similar mild head injuries.  Therefore, the current preliminary study aimed to use MRSI to determine if prolonged cerebral metabolic alterations occur in individuals with post-concussion syndrome following a mild TBI (mTBI) and if regions of altered cerebral metabolism are associated with changes in psychological functioning, including mood and coping style.
                        <br><br>
                        Methodology: This preliminary study included 13 individuals with mTBI and 6 control subjects.  Psychological tests were administered (when?) and measured domains including mood, perceived quality of life (QOL), and coping style.
                        <br><br>
                        Results: Differences in mood and QOL were found between groups, with mTBI being predictive of increased anxiety and depression, and poorer QOL.  However, mood and QOL did not influence cerebral metabolic rates. Moreover, it was found that coping style was predictive of alterations in cerebral metabolism. Specifically, significance tests suggested that the “accepting-responsibility” coping style had an influence on the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to creatine (Cr) ratio within the corpus callosum for mTBI subjects, with little impact for controls.
                        <br><br>
                        Conclusions:  The findings from the current study suggest that mTBI contributes to increased depression and anxiety and decreased QOL. These results also support the utility of MRS in the mTBI population, as decreases in NAA-based metabolic ratios have been identified in the mTBI population.  Understanding the possible relationship between cerebral metabolic and psychological changes may elucidate some reasons why some individuals experience chronic post-concussive psychological symptoms following mTBI and others do not.
