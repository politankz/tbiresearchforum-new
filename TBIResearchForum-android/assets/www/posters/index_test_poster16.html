                        Rationale: Travel to healthcare centers that provide specialized assessment and treatment can be burdensome for people who live far away, especially those with cognitive and emotional difficulties. This obstacle frequently results in reduced healthcare for those in need. To bridge the gap, several telecommunications media have been suggested, of which, telephone is the most widely available format.  We assessed the reliability of neuropsychological testing by telephone in a sample of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).
                        <br><br>
                        Method: 23 veterans with a history of moderate to severe TBI completed two test sessions, several weeks apart, in a test-retest protocol. The battery included standard, verbally administered tests of attention, working memory, processing speed, language, memory, and executive skills, as well as auditory-verbal adaptations of trail-making, visual search, and spatial reasoning tasks.
                        <br><br>
                        Results: All tests had moderate to high test-retest reliability (r = 0.7 to 0.9). As expected, practice effects were found for two verbal memory tasks; all other tests did not differ significantly between trials.
                        <br><br>
                        Conclusions: These findings verify that testing by telephone can provide reliable, stable scores across multiple neurocognitive domains, even in individuals with significant deficits. The results also support further development of auditory-verbal tests of visual and spatial abilities.  Future validation studies should assess the equivalence and limitations of testing by telephone, compared to traditional in-person testing.
