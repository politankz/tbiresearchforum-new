                        BACKGROUND: Nearly two-thirds of injured US soldiers sent from Iraq to Walter Reed Army Medical Center have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Many of these servicemen and women are also diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The co-occurrence of mild TBI and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is of great scientific interest given the number OEF/OIF veterans returning to civilian life. To date, few imaging studies have attempted to compare and contrast the neurological changes that occur in TBI and PTSD. Sustained efforts in this domain will likely reveal neurological similarities and differences that contribute to an understanding of their comorbidity. This study investigates the co-occurrence of TBI and PTSD in Veterans seen at The War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System. The goal of WRIISC is to understand the etiology of these disorders, make connections between brain states and their cognitive sequelae, and contribute knowledge toward rehabilitation efforts.
                        <br><br>
                        METHODOLOGY: Participants (n = 43; TBI = 6; PTSD only = 9; TBI/PTSD = 28; healthy controls = 10) were scanned in a 3T GE MRI (high-resolution T1 anatomical, 30 direction DTI sequence) and completed a battery of neuropsychological tests focusing on PTSD, TBI, and memory. DTI data were analyzed with custom software for the creation of tensor maps, identification of white matter tracts, and the extraction fractional anisotropy values (FA) values.
                        <br><br>
                        RESULTS: Pilot results revealed a decrease in average FA, particularly in the cingulum, and anterior thalamic projections, in patients TBI + PTSD compared to patients with PTSD only. CONCLUSIONS: Current results suggest that TBI + PTSD patients may have neurological damage in key fiber tracts beyond that of individuals with only PTSD. Further research is needed to evaluate the implications of this difference in terms of health outcomes for Veterans, as individuals with both TBI and PTSD might be at higher risk for other health problems.
