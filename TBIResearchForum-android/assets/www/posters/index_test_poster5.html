                        Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and neurological deficits that can persist more than a year after injury. The current preliminary study used 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to determine the nature of cognitive impairments and their relationship with chronic metabolic changes in mild TBI (mTBI) patients with chronic post-concussive symptoms.  This study aims to see if potential metabolic changes might explain reported differences in cognitive function between mTBI patients with similar injuries.
                        <br><br>
                        Methodology: This preliminary study included 13 mTBI subjects and 6 control subjects.  Neuropsychological tests measured intelligence, processing speed, abstract reasoning, attention, language, and visual construction.  MRSI was used to measure cerebral metabolism.
                        <br><br>
                        Results: It was found that performance on measures of cognitive functioning were predictive of alterations in cerebral metabolism. Specifically, significance tests suggested that performance on tasks of non-verbal abstraction and visual construction had an influence on the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to creatine (Cr) ratio (NAA/Cr) within the frontal white matter for mTBI subjects, with little to no impact for controls. This same pattern emerged for mTBI subjects on tasks of processing speed, phonemic and semantic language fluency, and mental flexibility, all of which predicted the NAA/Cr ratio within the thalami but again was not present for controls.  On attention tasks, there was a significant relationship between the choline (Cho) to creatine (Cr) ratio (Cho/Cr) within the corpus callosum and the parieto-occipital white matter for mTBI subjects, with little or no impact for controls.
                        <br><br>
                        Conclusions: The findings from the current study suggest that differential performance on cognitive tests in individuals with chronic post-concussive syndrome may be due, at least in part, to differences in cerebral metabolic changes as measured by MRSI.  These findings may also provide some impetus for exploring ways to alter cerebral metabolism as a treatment option for those who continue to struggle with cognitive difficulties post-injury.
