                        Traumatic cervical spinal cord injury with comorbid traumatic brain injury (TBI/SCI) is a devastating but underdiagnosed condition that is often accompanied by trauma to multiple internal organs. This poly-trauma may prolong the patients stay in rehabilitation and often has an adverse effect on a successful recovery of motor and cognitive function. Treatment options can influence how well a patient recovers from the injury, yet there is no standard of care for patients with these combined injuries. To address this issue, a collaboration between physicians and basic scientists was initiated to reverse-translate this syndrome into a preclinical model to facilitate testing of current pharmacological treatments that may target recovery of motor and cognitive function. Our approach consisted of parallel research efforts on the clinical and preclinical side. Clinically, we performed retrospective data mining of dual diagnosis patient records to characterize the impairment level and therapeutic features of these patients for inclusion in a novel animal model. The initial preclinical animal model-development aimed to reproduce forelimb and hindlimb deficits similar to those seen in dual-diagnosis patients (Inoue et al., submitted). The present abstract reports the clinical research component of this collaboration to inform future efforts to test the impact of medication history on recovery from dual diagnosis. We performed retrospective data collection from de- identified patient records from Santa Clara Valley Medical Center (SCVMC, n=14) and the VA Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS, n=10) for patients with a dual diagnosis of TBI and SCI at the time of admission (between 1989 and 2010). Clinical data was curated from admission and discharge notes, ICD-9 codes, medication lists, and Functional Independent Measure (FIM) scores. The database currently includes data on injury parameters, surgical procedures, diagnostic findings, physical and neurological exams, rehabilitation assessment plans, and medications administered at the time of admission and discharge. Preliminary results from querying the clinical component of the database revealed that most patients (n = 19) received treatment for the management of neurogenic bowel (e.g. docusate, senna, and bisacodyl), together with mild analgesics, antacids, and bronchodilators. In addition, assessment of FIM scores revealed a general trend toward improvement at discharge with large variability in the level of improvement. Future work will include determining whether the variability in FIM scores could be due to a particular drug treatment or other factors. Through ongoing development of this clinical database we hope to provide support for pharmacological therapeutics that may impact motor and cognitive recovery of function in dual-diagnosis patients.
