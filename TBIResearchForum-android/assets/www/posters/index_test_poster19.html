                        The War Related Illnesses and Injuries Studies Center (WRIISC) at the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Healthcare Center is one of three WRIISC sites in the nation. The WRIISC focuses on the health needs of post-deployment veterans. Post-deployment veterans are seen by a team of psychologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, neurologists, neuroradiologists, nurses, M.D.’s, researchers, and educators in order to best meet their unique health concerns. In our effort to develop research techniques for the potential benefit of our WRIISC patients, we have developed an image processing pipeline that incorporates a number of automated and semi-automated advanced neuroimaging processing tools. This poster will present them along with our developed workflow.
                        <br><br>
                        While potential sequelae of traumatic brain injury is well established as a clinical concern for deployed and veteran population, specific neuroimaging techniques that can be routinely evaluated in the clinical setting are lacking. Disjoint work evaluating variants of diffusion tensor imaging, white matter hyperintensity measurement, brain volume analysis, brain perfusion mapping and quantitative susceptibility mapping have been presented in the TBI literature, however a solution that performs these various forms of image processing, so that the data can then be evaluated in the context an individual patient’s clinical presentation is not available. We feel that until such methods can be performed in an automated or semi-automated manner, any evaluation of these methods’ ability to aid in clinical diagnosis and management will be limited.
                        <br><br>
                        We have established an image processing pipeline that performs brain volumetric analysis, with brain region segmentation, white matter hyperintensity analysis, diffusion tensor white matter tract analysis, and quantitative susceptibility mapping. We have integrated the process such that only a few steps require user interaction, mainly for the purposes of quality assurance. These processing steps are performed using a variety of publicly available image processing packages that are well established in the scientific literature, with the addition of various program elements to integrate their data workflow. The result is a set of images and data that convey various metrics derived from neuroimaging which can readily be integrated into the evaluation of individual subjects or groups.
                        <br><br>
                        In conjunction with the extensive neurocognitive testing and multidisciplinary clinical information obtained by groups such as the Palo Alto WRIISC, we believe the results from image processing pipelines, as the one described here will enable a new level of diagnosis and management for clinicians caring for patients with TBI.
